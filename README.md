# 3D Talking_Head_Zoo
A collection of interesting 3D talking heads.


# Introduction
In this repo, I'd like to share some video clips that contains 3D talking heads I've ever created. The raw video/audio materials are from various Youtube contents, and 3D assets are mostly free downloads from 3D marketplaces like [Free3D](https://free3d.com/), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/), and more.

This is like a hobby repo, I'll release finished clips occasionally.
